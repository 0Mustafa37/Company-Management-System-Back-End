  - Company: Number of departments, employees, projects
  - Department: Number of employees, projects
  - Employee: Days employed
- **Employee Performance Review Cycle**:
  - Stages: Pending Review â†’ Review Scheduled â†’ Feedback Provided â†’ Under Approval â†’ Review Approved/Rejected
  - Transitions strictly controlled
- **APIs**: RESTful endpoints for all entities
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests
- **Bonus**: Logging with Django logging module

## 4. Task Completion Checklist âœ…

- [x] **Data Models**  
  - User (Admin, Manager, Employee roles)  
  - Company (auto-calculated departments, employees, projects)  
  - Department (auto-calculated employees, projects)  
  - Employee (auto-calculated days employed)  
  - Project (bonus, with assigned employees)  

- [x] **CRUD Operations**  
  - Full RESTful APIs for all models (Company, Department, Employee, Project)  

- [x] **Employee Performance Review Workflow**  
  - Implemented with all defined stages & transitions  

- [x] **Role-Based Access Control**  
  - Different permissions for Admin, Manager, Employee  

- [x] **Authentication & Authorization**  
  - JWT-based secure authentication with refresh tokens  

- [x] **API Documentation**  
  - Endpoints, parameters, and example responses  

- [x] **Testing**  
  - Unit tests for models & APIs  
  - Integration tests for workflows  

- [ ] **Bonus: Logging**  
  - Basic logging implemented (optional improvement)

### ðŸ”¹ Assumptions
- "Days Employed" is only calculated if `hired_on` is set.  
- One employee belongs to exactly one company and one department.  
- Projects can have multiple employees assigned.  

---

## 5. Security Measures
- **Role-based access control**:
  - **Admin**: Full CRUD permissions across all models
  - **Manager**: Can manage employees, projects, and departments within their company
  - **Employee**: Limited to viewing personal details and assigned projects
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT tokens (access + refresh)
- **Authorization**: DRF permissions (`IsAuthenticated`, custom role-based permissions)
- **Data Protection**: Passwords securely hashed with Djangoâ€™s PBKDF2
